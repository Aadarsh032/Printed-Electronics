      description: "Assistant Professor  Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, India The concept of printing (adhering or depositing or transferring material layers onto a surface) has revolutionized the way information or knowledge and ideas are shared in the form of articles and textbooks in modern knowledge-based economies. The printing revolution started after the invention of the mechanical movable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 1440s. In fact, printing is considered the most important invention of the second millennium, as it has led the mass communication, and learning and played a key role in the scientific revolution. Currently, printing is beyond simple text and has been playing a key role in modern fabrication technologies, especially electronics called “Printed Electronics (PE)”, which is a process of depositing electronically functional materials on different surfaces (paper, plastic, glass, and cardboard, etc.) using printing techniques. PE is a complementary technology to conventional silicon-based electronics, as it offers low-cost, large area and volume manufacturing for several applications such as displays, solar cells, sensors, e-textiles, piezoelectric transducers, etc. In our lab, we focus on developing printed field-effect transistors (FETs) and CMOS logics using oxide semiconductors and sensors based on organic transistors, which can be used for environmental monitoring and health diagnostics. In addition, we also develop printed/solution-processed memristors for storage and neuromorphic computing applications. Our work has been published in reputed journals such as ACS applied materials & interfaces, Small, ACS Nano, Advanced Materials, Advanced Electronic Materials, and NatureCommunications as well. With our research, we strive to contribute to the growth of India and the world. "
